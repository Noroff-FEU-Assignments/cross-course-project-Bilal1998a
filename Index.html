    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">A secure URL should begin with “https” rather than “http.” You can also sanitize the data witch will ensure that the data system only accepts the right format. You can also use the method "Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD)" witch will run every change against some security checks and decides the delivery of the change to productions. If there is any change that does not pass, it will be red flagged.</p>
